Neural Network Image Classification
This project involves the development of a Neural Network from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

Key Features:
Custom Implementation: Built the neural network architecture without relying on deep learning libraries.
Forward and Backpropagation: Implemented the forward and backward propagation algorithms to facilitate learning.
Optimization: Utilized gradient descent for optimizing the model's performance.
Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 87% on the MNIST dataset.

Overview:
The project provided an in-depth understanding of the inner workings of neural networks, including matrix multiplication, activation functions, and optimization techniques. This hands-on experience enhanced my problem-solving skills and solidified my foundation in machine learning concepts.
